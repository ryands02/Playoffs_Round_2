## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
# Sys.setenv(VROOM_CONNECTION_SIZE=500072)
assign_nba_players()
win_probability()
```

```{r}
players_tables(players=c("Lebron James", "James Harden"), tables=c("game splits", "general splits", "player on off details", "year over year"), measures=c("Base", "Advanced"),modes=c("PerGame","Totals","Per36"), assign_to_environment = TRUE)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
lebron_totals <- players_careers(players = c("LeBron James"),
                modes = c("Totals"))
```

```{r}
gamedata <- game_logs(seasons = c(2008,2009,2010,2011,2012,2013,2014,2015,2016,2017,2018,2019,2020))
```

```{r}
gamedata <- game_logs(seasons = c(2007,2008,2009,2010,2011,2012,2013,2014,2015,2016,2017,2018,2019,2020,2021,2022))
head(gamedata)
tor_at_cha <- gamedata %>% 
  filter(slugTeam=="CHA",locationGame=="H",slugOpponent=="TOR") %>%
  mutate(per_pred = 0.68 + 26.77*fgm - 35.58*fga + 26.32*ftm - 25.47*fta + 42.74*oreb + 11.45*dreb + 29.7*ast + 47.3*stl + 38*blk - 47.9*tov - 18.8*pf + 41.1*pts) %>%
  select(namePlayer,pts,oreb,minutes,outcomeGame,slugTeam,slugOpponent,yearSeason,per_pred)
head(tor_at_cha,20)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
